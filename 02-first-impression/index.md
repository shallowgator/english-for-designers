## About

<!-- Consider including a headshot. We’re not designing, so keep the image width/height around 320px x 320px (square). Replace "surname" with your surname in the file name. -->

![Write an alternative text description.](img/surname-headshot.jpg)

A short description about yourself. Think — alt text description length, a max of 125 characters, short and sweet. If you go over, that’s okay — edits are free.

## Featured Projects

A short description about the work.

### Featured Project 1 Title

<!-- Use a static poster image or animated GIF, but no video files. Again, keep the image width/height manageable, around 1280x x 720px (16:9 aspect ratio), or a max-width of 1280px. -->

![Write an alternative text description.](img/featured-project-01.png)

- A short description about the project — *the what*.
- A short description about the significance of the project — *the whys*.
- A short description about the outcome of the project — *the result or takeaway*.

<!-- Use the same stucture above for the rest of your featured projects. -->
