## About me

<!-- Consider including a headshot. We’re not designing, so keep the image width/height around 320px x 320px (square). Replace "surname" with your surname in the file name. -->

There is not enough hours in a day to cater to all of my interests. 
My name is Matúš Šeliga and I’m a generalist who can do just about anything you want me to with varying levels of success but never without any interest and authenticity.
For four years I studied ceramic design at ŠUP Josefa Vydru in Bratislava, Slovakia. Currently I'm studying animation and VFX at VSKK in Prague.

## Featured Projects

One of my all-time personal endeavors is a perpetual multimedia project I named:

### shallow gator

<!-- Use a static poster image or animated GIF, but no video files. Again, keep the image width/height manageable, around 1280x x 720px (16:9 aspect ratio), or a max-width of 1280px. -->

![Write an alternative text description.](img/featured-project-01.png)

- A short description about the project — *the what*.
- A short description about the significance of the project — *the whys*.
- A short description about the outcome of the project — *the result or takeaway*.

<!-- Use the same stucture above for the rest of your featured projects. -->
