## About me

<!-- Consider including a headshot. We’re not designing, so keep the image width/height around 320px x 320px (square). Replace "surname" with your surname in the file name. -->

There is not enough hours in a day to cater to all of my interests. 
My name is Matúš Šeliga and I’m a generalist who can do just about anything you want me to with varying levels of success but never without any interest and authenticity.
I studied ceramic design at ŠUP Josefa Vydru in Bratislava, Slovakia. Currently studying animation and VFX at VSKK in Prague.
