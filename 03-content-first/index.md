## Howdy, round these parts I'm known (or unknown) as Matúš (or Matthew). I'm mainly an illustrator but I have a lot of curiosity and I like to shift my focus (atm also moonlighting as a private detective).

I also dabble in 3D, VFX, video editing, poetry/writing and playing/producing/recording music. I harbor deep admiration, fascination and enthusiasm for all kinds of creative endeavors. If you'd fancy more info: [smack me](about.md).
