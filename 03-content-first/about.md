## ABOUT

![A stylized drawing of myself.](img/seliga-headshot.png)

I'm from Slovakia specifically from a small town near Bratislava currently living and studying in Prague. I can be a bit indecisive when it comes to figuring out what to do with my life and i never want it to be "set i stone". I graduated from ceramic design art school and the four years gave me a lot of curiosity and admiration for a whole range of different mediums.
My free time is split between doing visual art (as you may have alredy noticed from my [Work](work.md)) as well as making music and the occasional gym workout/run.
