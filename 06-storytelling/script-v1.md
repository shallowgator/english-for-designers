#### What is music?
If you are boring or maybe a robot you might've responded with "Music is wiggly air entering your eardrum vibrating it.", this is not entirely true. Of course on the surface level you can think about it like that but that
stands in complete disregard to the whole human condition.

In a way, we can break down how we "absorb"(?) music to 2 aspects:

#### The "Emotional"?
Music might register just as wiggly air if you're stone cold machine on a mission to ruin everyone's fun. Did that wiggly air just make me cry? Did it just remind me of a time in my life i wouldn't have remembered otherwise?
We must not underestimate the emotional potecial of music and how it ties and merges with it's surroundings. I mean, if you saw a car crash(?), some very strong emotional moment i'd think you'd remember the song that was
playing in that moment or if you didn't know it, you'd strongly associate it with that exact moment. You are experiencing music differently in every moment: sick in the bathroom of a club, on a tram playing from some kids
bluetooth speaker, walking alone with headphones on, your friend playing a song from his shitty phone speaker. 
 
#### The Technical
Even in technical speak, music is not just what eneters your ears. On concerts you can feel the low bass frequencies with your whole body.

#### Visualization
##### What do you think about when someone asks you to visualize music?
You might think of old Windows, PSP visualizers etc. maybe
