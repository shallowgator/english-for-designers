## Script v1
#### What is music?
If you are boring or maybe a robot you might've responded with "Music is wiggly air entering your eardrum vibrating it.", this is not entirely true. Of course on the surface level you can think about it like that but that
stands in complete disregard to the human condition.
In a way, we can break down music to 2 aspects:

#### The "Emotional"?
#### The Technical
Music might register just as wiggly air if you're stone cold machine on a mission to ruin everyone's fun. Did that wiggly air just make me cry? Did it just remind me of a time in my life i wouldn't have remembered otherwise?
