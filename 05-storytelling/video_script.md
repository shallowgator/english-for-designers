### Music?
#### or whatever you want to hear.

  What is music exactly? If we take it at face value from a physics or musicological standpoint music is basically vibration that vibrates the air and the air then travels to your ears and that in turn vibrates your eardrums,
forcing you to listen tu music.
But of course, due to the nature of human condition the musical experience is infinitely more complex, as does everything humans get involved with. 
Even deaf people attend concerts and enjoy music thanks to the bass vibrations and more abstract concepts like atmosphere etc.
  Atmosphere is a thing that greatly impacts our perception of music.
Alone, home on a rainy day, hearing club bangers puking your guts out on the toilet or  
You're gonna think differently about a song that played at your wedding or one that you listened to during your first heartbreak.
For example, I have one album that instantly transports me to summer 2019.
  Music is a in-the-moment experience. It was just until recently, mid 1800, when the first music recordings were made. Unlike paintings, you can only experience it in the passing moment the song is playing. Once the song
ends, the music is no more.
Another thing about this is that in different points of your life you perceive music completely differently. Something you disliked a few years ago can become your favourite and vice-versa. 
Mayhaps the most clear example I could point out is the universal case of aging. In relation to music, this means that as our lives pass we gradually loose the abilty to hear higher pitches if not the ability to hear
all-around. You ought to enjoy the music while you can in whatever capacity you're able to.
On a personal note, one time I suffered double ear infection culminating in partial deafness in my left ear. I can tell you, after this ordeal I never enjoyed my newfound stereo hearing abilty more.
