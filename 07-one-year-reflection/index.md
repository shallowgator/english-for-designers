# 1(one) Year Reflection
## Oh my god. Who am I, what did I do and what am I doing?
  It is May now. I don't remeber what was I doing this time last year. I have to check my camera roll, hold on a second. I was living a very similar yet completely different life. I'm still living in the apartment i did then, still going to the same school, yet everything feels different. As if the veil of present combined with hazy memory completely transformed everything. Every day feels the same yet when you look back everything seems different. I was supposed to end my animation bachelor this year, then I guess I'd find an apartment and a job and live out the rest of my stereotypical life day by day like some kind of treachery of your teenage self's expectation. But no, I'm extending my bachelor's to the next year. Is this just procrastination? Maybe, partly? Am I just too scared to go to the "real-world"? Yes, maybe a bit? Do I want to extend my beautiful young and healthy student lifestyle? YES. Do my parents love this decision? After explaining it further, they seemed fine with it. No, really. You see, if everything falls into place I can go on a max. half-year internship wherever I manage to land a position. I think these are great opportunities I can't access once I graduate. I need to make the most of it right now, while it's happening. 
  I wake up in cold sweat from vivid nightmares. Everything is very uncertain and I'm not sure about what to expect in the future. Everything will change and then it'll change again and again and keep changing, for better of for worse... I guess maybe that's still better than nothing ever changing? Both sound dreadful. But I picked this and I have to stick with it. Or I DON'T HAVE to stick with it but then I'd have to stick with not sticking with it. I'm excited and nervous about what the future holds. But I'll try to manage.
