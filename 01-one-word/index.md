# “Enough is enough and I’ve had enough.”

  There are some words that could in a single moment turn my skin inside-out, make me wail with joy or make me scream in agonising pain. But one world alone in a vacuum is, on its own, not powerful enough to do that. But just like people and everything else we interact with; words don’t exist in a vacuum. They function in texts; with all the context, subtext, metaphors and everything else. A normal person can not comprehend all of it. And in that regard, words are very powerful. They make up the fabric of all conversations from romantic to academic and so on and so forth. The words may change but the meaning doesn’t. At least I hope so.

  So, let’s face it. I’ve been thinking about words. But after I got tired of it one word kind of got stuck in my head. Now, it’s not that I somehow “hate” that word, or that I wouldn’t ever use it or something. I sort of feel that the word leaves you wanting more. The more I thought about it the more angry and frustrated I got. Not at that word though, it’s working as it should and that’s how words work, right?

To better understand what I’m talking about, I’m going to list a bunch of examples – and my personal reaction to them.

  Examples: 

“You’re enough.” is this supposed to be positive? Am I enough for what? Can I ever be something more than enough? It feels like only settling with me cause “it’s good enough” right?

“You’re not enough.”?? God that hurts. Am I not enough for what? In every regard? Not good enough to enrol in the school I wanted to or to get the job I wanted etc.

“I’ve done enough” just sounds like I should’ve done more (or less) but for whatever reason I didn’t and/or couldn’t.

“I’ve had enough”. Sounding out with this loud sigh of defeat. A vague scene of leaving out the door, feels so sad and melancholic; and lonely.

“I’ve had enough... to drink”?? Not only you’re most likely pissed out of your mind, while you stumble through slurring the sentence out. But you’re also letting down all your mates in the process. Sure, it’s the responsible thing to do. At least regarding your finances and your personal health. But it doesn’t always work out, now does it?

  Depending on context, whilst using the word “enough”, someone always ends up disappointed in some way. The word can end up making the sentence feel more neutral, humorous, or even just plain sad. As I’ve said before, this doesn’t mean that we should avoid that word. I guess it makes a point that you should in fact think before you speak (or write).
