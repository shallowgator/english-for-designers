## Rough Draft

# Just

I ask for Twitter help when stuck. "Just" makes me feel stupid. Crowdsourcing is great, but that word hurts.

We must step out of our perspective. Imagine explaining to a past self. Hypertext adds context. Knowledge grows.

Avoid assumptions in docs, posts, tutorials. "Just" assumes too much. Learning buzzwords is tough. Think before suggesting "just."
