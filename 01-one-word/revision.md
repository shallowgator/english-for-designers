# Just

### Hook

There are some words that could in a single moment turn my skin inside-out, make me wail with joy or make me scream in agonising pain.

**“Just…”**

As in “**Just** update your ruby gems, generate a new SSH key, and run a git rebase…“

“**Just** clone the dev branch, add those three grunt tasks, and recompile…”

“**Just** use this <del>software/platform/toolkit/methodology</del> <ins>software, platform, toolkit, method</ins>…”

### Thesis Statement

“Just” makes me feel like an idiot. “Just” presumes I come from a specific background<del>,</del><ins>and</ins> studied certain courses in university<del>, am fluent</del><ins>. And fluent</ins> in certain technologies<del>, and</del><ins>. And</ins> have read all the right books, articles, and resources. “Just” is a dangerous word.

### The Whys


### Conclusion

Depending on context, whilst using the word “enough”, someone always ends up disappointed in some way. The word can end up making the sentence feel more neutral, humorous, or even just plain sad. As I’ve said before, this doesn’t mean that we should avoid that word. I guess it makes a point that you should in fact think before you speak (or write).


I don’t envy those just entering the field of web development. <del>In addition to</del> <ins>Besides</ins> learning the <del>fundamentals</del> <ins>basics</ins>, there’s an expectation to be proficient in an <del>increasingly exhausting</del> <ins>endless</ins> laundry list of buzzwords and technologies. I’m seven years into my career and still feel like I’m still on Chapter 1 of the Big Book of Web Design.

### Takeaway

So think twice before suggesting someone “just” [insert any task here]. You just might make them feel like an idiot.
