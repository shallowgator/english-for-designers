### Hook

There are some words that could in a single moment turn my skin inside-out, make me wail with joy or make me scream in agonising pain.

**“Enough.”**

### Thesis Statement


### The Whys

?

### Conclusion

Depending on context, whilst using the word “enough”, someone always ends up disappointed in some way. The word can end up making the sentence feel more neutral, humorous, or even just plain sad. As I’ve said before, this doesn’t mean that we should avoid that word. I guess it makes a point that you should in fact think before you speak (or write).

### Takeaway
