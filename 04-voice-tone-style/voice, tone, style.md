# My voice, tone and style
## *Voice*

#### *Calm and captivating (for people who ought to be captivated)*

Not one for over-the-top shenanigans directed to catch attention. Be true to yourself and don't try to catch everyone's interest, you don't really want everyone's interest. Instead try developing meaningful relationships that others benefit from as well as you.

#### *Introspective and if possible collected*

Try to stay calm in most situations. When you act rashly, in-the-moment or on impulse you may do something you don't really want to do. Let it flow through your head, sleep on it, make an informed decision you can feel confident in, because decisions and words may represent you as a person.

#### *Hopefully never completely defined*

Never want to come off too strong, to some it may feel like cowardice or "holding back" the opposite may be superfluous and shallow. I think you can never be 100% sure of the next step. Be confident in your choice but never blindly fall for your own conviction. Everything can change in a split-second, including you, beliefs you hold or the entire world. On the edge of familiarity.

## *Tone*

#### *Somewhat sarcastic, jokey and not overly serious*

Puns, word-games, situational comedy, sarcasm etc. are a good way to entertain yourself and others and have a chuckle while you're at it.

#### *Trying to be realistic, empathetic and objective*

Everyone's worldview is different in things ranging from big to small. Don't always try to be right, instead try to find common ground and understand, or to the very least, respect each other. This effort may often be unreciprocated. In that case it is often futile to argue when open dialogue fails, try to save your and everyones time. Adapt to the situation.

## *Style*

Funny memes like "the fog is coming".
Overcomplicated and/or cryptic words.
Usage of / (slashes) - (dashes) and () (parentheses).
If possible just lowercase letters.
